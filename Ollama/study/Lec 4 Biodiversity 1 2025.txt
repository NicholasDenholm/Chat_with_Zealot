Origin of  Eukaryotes
•Cells existing prior to 2.2 byawere all  
prokaryotes: Bacteria andArchaea.
•Eukaryotes appear in the fossil record ca.
1.7 - 2.1bya. (Grypania  sp.)
•Chemical markers (steranes) produced  
only by eukaryotes are detected inrocks
~2.7 bya.
•How did eukaryotes differ?

=============== Page 4 ===============
Prokaryotes have no nucleus, organelles, or microtubules and  
have 70Sribosomes. They have an outer cell wall composed  
ofpeptidoglycan. They are generally small, <2 µm in  
diameter.  DNA in single chromosome. Divide by binary fission.

Endosymbiotic Theory of Origin of  
Eukaryotes
•Theory advanced by Lynn Margulis.
•Mitochondria and chloroplasts of  
eucaryotes were at one time free-living  
bacteria that were engulfed by an Archae on
and evolved from an obligatory symbiosis.
•Mitochondria –proteobacterium
•Chloroplast -cyanobacterium
•Theory very strongly supported bydata

Evidence for Endosymbiotic Theory
Organelles (chloroplasts and mitochondria):
1.contain their own DNA that is similar to  
bacterial DNA: no histones, circular.
2.are surrounded by a double membrane 
– the inner one looks like a  bacterial 
membrane

Organelles (chloroplasts and mitochondria):
3.electron transport chain of mitochondria is 
located in  the inner membrane and is in 
the outer membrane of bacteria
4.show antibiotic sensitivity
5.have ribosomes (70S) like bacteriaEvidence for Endosymbiotic  Theory

Classification
•Method for organizing information
–Grouping similar organisms together.
–Historically, it involved grouping organisms into  
different categories based on their physical  
characteristics (hard formicrobes).
•Ideally it should reflect the evolutionary  
distances and relationships among organisms.
–Predict characteristics of newly described organisms
–Understand the history oflife
=============== Page 14 ===============
Difficulty in Classifying  Microorganisms
•Morphologically simple –they have fewer  
obvious features that can be used to  
measure relatedness ofspecies.
–DNA proposed because it is found in all  
organisms
–Transmission of genetic information captures  
ancestral relationships  (parents pass genes 
to offspring – ancestral organisms pass 
genes to descendants) 
–Slowly changing  (e.g. low copying error)
–DNA is l arge enough molecule to 
record useful info. on evolutionary
change
=============== Page 15 ===============
Molecular Phylogeny
•RNA gene sequence analysis identifies 3 major  
lineages (Called domains )(Carl Woese 1977):
–Bacteria (prokaryote)
–Archaea (prokaryote)
–Eukarya (eukaryote)
Classification within each domain is based on rRNA or  
more recently using a number ofdifferent genes .

Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)  
and the Tree of Life
•What if genes were not only transferred vertically  
from parent to offspring (ancestor to  
descendent)?
•During endosymbiosis genes were transferred  
from the endosymbiont to the host genome  
(EGT)
•HGT is also effected by a virus or a small,  
circular DNA particle known as a plasmid that  
contains a foreign gene that can be transferred.
–20% of the E. coli genome can be traced toHGT
–1/3 of the genome of some prokaryotic organisms has  
been acquired through HGT
=============== Page 19 ===============
Eukarya
•Originated 2.7 - 1.7bya 
Historically considered to 
contain  the 4 Kingdoms: 
Plants , Animals , Fungi ,
Protists
•Protists -
–Mostly unicellular  
eukaryotes
–Include parasitic,  
photosynthetic,  
heterotrophic forms.
–Between 12 -32 phyla are  
described.
–Artificial group
